[00:22.34] Never give up just live up
[00:24.12] Fed upon America
[00:25.40] We be spittin' it up
[00:26.52] Rippin' it up
[00:27.54] For an even amount in each cup
[00:29.16] To my brothers burning bare feet on black top
[00:31.75] Whose curled 'neath tha shadows
[00:32.98] From tha gaze of tha cops
[00:34.19] Whose huntin' for 9 to 5's through factory locks
[00:36.48] Is now hunted on this modern day auction block
[00:39.48] Mic Check, ha ha ha

[01:09.74] With complex text
[01:10.86] Fast and in a fashion
[01:12.11] That snap back necks
[01:13.28] Quicker than a fed cash tha company checks
[01:15.80] Come with tha fire only Marley could catch
[01:18.37] This be tha flame in tha cellar beware
[01:20.81] Nameless cold millions gaspin' for air
[01:23.35] Those naked and wageless
[01:24.59] Now scream within cages
[01:25.80] What, they make you pull your shit
[01:27.24] Just to get your share, what?

[02:33.55] Tha mass of tha few in this torn nation?
[02:35.93] Tha priest tha book or tha congregation?
[02:38.37] Tha politricks who rob and hold down your zone?
[02:40.77] Or those who give tha thieves tha key to their homes?
[02:43.36] Tha pig who's free to murder one Shucklak
[02:45.58] Or survivors who make a move and murder one back?
[02:48.23] This mic device
[02:49.26] I spit nonfiction
